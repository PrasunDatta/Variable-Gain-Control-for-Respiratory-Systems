# Variable-Gain-Control-for-Respiratory-Systems
This work is basically the final project of the course -"EEE 318 Control Systems I Laboratory". Here we have reproduced the paper<b>  "Variable-Gain Control for Respiratory Systems".</b>

## Abstract
<p align ="justify" >
In this paper, we introduce a variable-gain control
strategy for mechanical ventilators in the respiratory systems.
Respiratory systems assist the patients who have difficulty
breathing on their own. For the comfort of the patient, fast
pressure buildup (and release) and a stable flow response are
desired. However, linear controllers typically need to balance
between these conflicting objectives. In order to balance this
tradeoff in a more desirable manner, a variable-gain controller
is proposed, which switches the controller gain based on the
magnitude of the patient flow. The effectiveness of the control
strategy is demonstrated in experiments on different test lungs. </p>
